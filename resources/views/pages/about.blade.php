			<p class="space-bottom">Escape To Shape is the vision of Erica Gragg and Francesco Anchisi, two 'gypsetters'* who believe in a sophisticated yet down-to-earth way of living- blending traveling, local flavors, experiences and entertaining with balance &amp; wellness. Together the two have successfully married their passions for travel and cultural connections with fitness and wellness, creating a unique and rewarding way to experience the world. Each unique ESCAPE TO SHAPE location provides a perfect backdrop and platform for discerning guests to re-discover themselves while discovering a new culture.</p>

			<p class="space-bottom">Each location, activity and menu is hand selected and curated by Erica and Francesco so as to ensure that guests experience the most authentic and very best each culture has to offer- a blend of cultural 'must sees' with an 'in-the-know' edge and off-the-beaten path treasures. Erica and Francesco host each Escape and provide a welcoming and intimate backdrop- similar to visiting a close friendâ€™s private villa. Past guests have enjoyed African dance lessons in Cape Town, South Africa; trekking horseback through the vineyards in Colonia, Uruguay; experiencing an authentic Berber meal in the peaks of the Atlas Mountains in Marrakech; exploring  the architecture of magnificent St Petersburg, Russia with a historian; practicing yoga in the underground cisterns of Istanbul, Turkey; journeying inside a volcano in Iceland; savoring the sunrise over the temples of Angkor Wat in Cambodia, swimming with baby sea lions in Galapagos, Ecuador and hiking peaks &amp; valleys in breathtaking Bhutan, plus much, much more. All this combined with luxurious accommodations, delicious food, daily yoga and/or fitness classes, hiking, culinary delights, cultural (& shopping!) discoveries, unique activities reflective of the region + lots of laughter.</p>

		<p class="space-bottom">Stateside, Brandon Gragg, also a partner in Escape To Shape, holds down the fort behind the scenes, overseeing many aspects of the bookkeeping &amp; marketing side of the business... and occasionally making guest appearances in locations around the world.</p>
