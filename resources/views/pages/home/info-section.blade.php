				<p class="large-body-text"><span class="emphasis">Wellness</span> is the new luxury, and to us wellness means taking care of yourself from the inside out; it means enjoying life's gifts, playing in the sand, savoring the sunsets, connecting to others in meaningful ways. It means returning home with a healthy glow, fit & refreshed. Wellness should be sustainable, livable, enjoyable, should make you feel great, healthy, balanced and alive.</p>

				<p><span class="emphasis">Travel</span> means different things to different people. But to us, travel is not simply about visiting another culture. It is about so much more. It is about sharing your gifts with those that have less, even if through just a smile; it is about opening your eyes to the various ways that the world works, beyond your own ideas; it is about true human connection with a person from another culture & about a deep reconnection with yourself.
				To truly travel means your heart is both broken & opened, simultaneously.</p>

				<p>Ready to have your breath taken away? To be touched by a culture and people so deep, so rich, so moving? To cross a destination off your bucket AND ​see how WELLNESS feels?</p>
